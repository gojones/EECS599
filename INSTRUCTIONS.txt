Instructions 
1. If not already done, install MySQL and the MySQLdb python module on your computer
2. Make sure the mysql server is running
	should work with 
		$sudo service mysqld start
	but there are many different ways to start it and it varies for different 
	operating systems. 
3. Create the financial_data database
		$ mysql -u root -p
		then enter root password
	Once in mysql 
		mysql> create database financial_data;
	If you want to have access to the database with another user, 
		mysql> create user ‘username’@‘localhost’
	Must grant privileges to new user
		mysql> grant usage on *.* to username@localhost identified by ‘password’
			- allows username to connect with password ‘password’
		mysql> grant all privileges on financial_data.* to username@localhost
4. The create engine statement to access a database in the python code should look something like this:
	dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database
Since we are using python and mysqldb, for 
	username = scott
	password = tiger
	database = financial_data
the create engine statement will be this
	engine = create_engine(‘mysql+mysqldb://scott:tiger@localhost/financial_data')

5. To run the programs using crontab, make sure !#/usr/bin/python is at the top of the
python program you want to run, then open crontab with 
	$sudo crontab -e
and the crontab entries should look like 
	* * * * * /path/to/python/script/…/pythonscript.py
